yYsgm8jf2Rk,How to Train for Skiing and Ski Mountaineering | Stomp It Pod,All skiing,Podcast,Ski Mountaineering,NA,2021-10-24T11:14:16Z,"In this episode, I talk to Sam Naney director of coaching at Uphill Athlete. This episode came about thanks to my own lack of aerobic fitness which I felt was holding me back from ski touring / ski mountaineering as safe and quickly as I would have liked to. Thus I wanted to learn more about training for ski mountaineering and general health and well-being. Listen to it on your favourite Podcast platform https://anchor.fm/stomp-it-pod

IG: @samuelnaney, @uphillathlete
https://uphillathlete.com/model-of-endurance-training/
https://www.facebook.com/uphillathlete/

https://anchor.fm/stomp-it-pod

00:00 Intro
02:19 Introducing | Sam Naney
08:16 What is the difference? | Running vs Ski mountaineering
15:17 Heart rate monitors | How reliable are their training zones?
17:00 Mountain training | Building aerobic capacity 
25:44 High-Intensity Training  | How much do we need? 
28:28 High-Intensity Interval Training  | How to use HIIT for ski mountaineering?
32:30 High-Intensity Interval Training  | When to add weight to carry?   
42:29 Add to the todo | Single leg strength
47:15 How to structure your training | LIT, HIT and Strength?   
58:14 Personal fitness level | How to test it?
01:00:51 Aerobic Threshold | Find it with the MAF Formula

Fun and useful links:
- Sandcastle metaphor https://uphillathlete.com/model-of-endurance-training/
- Quick and dirty aerobic threshold estimate: https://philmaffetone.com/180-formula/
- Heart rate drift test: https://uphillathlete.com/heart-rate-drift-test/
- Lab test: https://uphillathlete.com/lab-metabolic-test/
- When to add HITT https://uphillathlete.com/when-to-add-intensity-training/

Summary
- I strongly recommend reading the Sandcastle metaphor https://uphillathlete.com/model-of-endurance-training/
- The reason we train is so we can do more of what we love
- Difference between stamina for “flat running” vs Uphill sports such a ski touring?
 - Flat = High cadence runner
 - UpHill = Low Cadence walking up mountains
 - Flat = Light packing
 - UpHill = Heavier / Require more strength (During my first 4000m project I carried 32,5kg of skis and mountain equipment)
- Similarities
 - Both require good aerobic fitness
 - Muscular fitness
 - Identify the objective and work backwards to plan you training

- 90% of Training | Identify  your personal Aerobic threshold (AeT) and train 90% of the time at or below AeT
 - Quick and dirty aerobic threshold estimate: https://philmaffetone.com/180-formula/
 - Heart rate drift test: https://uphillathlete.com/heart-rate-drift-test/
 - Lab test: https://uphillathlete.com/lab-metabolic-test/
 - When to add HITT https://uphillathlete.com/when-to-add-intensity-training/
- 10%
 - Nice long warm up then 4-5 X 5 minutes uphill running/hiking at Anaerobic Threshold
 - Hit the gym
  - Build strength while skiing
  - Do single leg exercises
   - Lounges
   - Split Squats
   - Step up on a box
  - Train the prime movers
   - Squats
   - Deadlifts
  - Core strength
  -  Stretch
-  How to structure a training week | LIT, HIT and Strength?
 - 90% of the training at or below Aerobic Threshold
 - The remaining 10%
  - Strength
  - HIIT 
   - 4-5x 5minutes at Anaerobic threshold fitness burning carbs
- Add training volume
 - Training makes you weak resting gets you stronger so balance is important
 - 3 weeks building activity up while adding 1 hour more of Aerobic training with 1 hour every week
 - 4th week easy (Drop the training volume with 30%-40%)
 -  Do another 3 weeks of building volume
 - Careful to not to over do and find a coach like Sam to help guide you.

v8U1wpVOCFI,Awesome Piste Skiing Equipment | Long-Term Ski Review,Ski Tech,Review,Gear,NA,2024-10-26T14:00:55Z,"In this video, Jens gives a detailed long-term review of Piste skis and the Carv ski boot unit. He covers his favourite skis—the S9 World Cup, G9, and Atomic X9s—discussing their pros, cons, and who they're best for. He also shares personal insights and experiences using each ski. Jens then reviews the Carv unit, highlighting how it enhances skiing, makes solo runs more fun, and offers valuable feedback while noting its downsides, like interfering with social interaction and no upper body tracking. Perfect for intermediate to expert skiers looking for honest opinions on skis and the Carv unit! Book a Camp → ⛷️ https://stompitcamps.com/ 🚡

ALxye0ipGH8,Learning How to Crevasse Rescue | Into the Mountains 4,Freeride,Spotlight,Ski Mountaineering,NA,2023-12-20T14:45:45Z,"In this episode of Into the Mountains I go to Chamonix with the plan to ski my lives steepest couloir but due to avalanche danger we had to change the plan and focus on learning about how to navigate around on glaicers and learn how to crevasse rescue. Performing a crevasse rescue is rather complicated and needs to be trained with a professional Mountain Guide like Dave. My hope for this content is to show all the training and practise it takes to hopefully inspire you to also take mountaineering classes or days out with guides to learn.  Stay safe and be well! Thank you @DaveSearle and look forward to ski something steeper next time.

Doing this ski drill will help you learn to use the two techniques we got to achieve high edge angles when carving on skis. The first technique is to incline into the turn then later in the turn add the angulation to both get high edge angles as well as pressure onto the outside ski to maintain grip.

The word is german for ""ab"" meaning down and seil translates to rope which gives the lovely word abseil ""to down rope"". I also had the pleasure to practise the scary skill of making a snow anchor to abseil off down an ice fall into a lovely little couloir. The last skill I was pleased to get to practise was how to ski cut (to try to release an avalanche to make the couloir safer afterwards). Enjoy.

Sj7pwMvJLsQ,How To K-fed on Skis | FS Swop to BS 270 Out,Freestyle,Tutorial,Jibbing,Intermediate,2017-01-13T08:41:35Z,"In this video we break down how you can learn K-Fed on skis. We show you two different ways you can do it and when each way of doing it is suitable. We first practise on grass with a practise rail/stick I pulled out of the ground then how to do it on skis. 

First way of doing the K-fed we use counter rotation to get on to the rail lock/scissor a bit then counter rotate the swop so you land on the rail with a nice wind up. Doing the K-Fed this way you can spin pretty fast of the rail and it is pretty good for learning Super Fed or if you feel comfortable with doing unnatural backside 270 out. 

Second way we show you how to do it is by rotating onto the rail lock it /scissor hard to stop the rotation while you wind up some rotation on the rail. Then unwind/spin hard while doing the swop and just land on the rail and continue the rotation. This way of doing the K-Fed is great if your not so good at unnatural backside 270´s out or if you want to do one footed K-Fed´s.

aaHjausCR4w,The Craziest Ski Ever Made Plus 4 Cool Ski News for 2021 | Ispo,All skiing,Review,Gear,NA,2020-02-04T13:21:08Z,"In this video, we first visit Line skis who for their first time has developed something that looks like a carving ski but wide like an all-mountain ski and designed by a vampire slayer. It made us ask our selves. Is this the ski of the future? After having our minds blown we check out the colourful new Völkl Revolt 104 which is breaking its way into the carvy all-mountain twin tip segment with a somewhat tight radius and playful feel. We finish off the video by looking at the new biding from Marker, the Duke PT. Which is about to go head to head with the popular shift binding. Its pro is a DIN 16 and might be durable but at the cost of being on the heavy side with its 1450 grams. We also look at an underdog binding company called B.A.M who has developed a similar but really different system to both the Shift and the Duke PT.

They range from minimalist backpacks designed by a company that values its products over its brand image, to trampoline skis that you can use at home and a smartwatch that can track your runs, speed, altitude and even act as an emergency beacon. Not all of these are necessarily ""cool"" though, what do you think of some of these interesting accessories?

s8ARRm_Pu0g,My First Freeride Ski Competition & What I Learned | Vlog,Freeride,Vlog,General (freeride),NA,2019-05-07T12:42:25Z,"First of all turn on subtitles. In this video, I share the whole experience of what it was like to do my first freeride competition. I show you how we where scouting lines, thinking about my strategy to keep up with the other young and gnarly competitors. Despite taking it sort of easy I managed to score high enough to get the 7th place despite backslapping in my first run. The main reason I made this video is to show how much fun it can be to join and go outside of your comfort zone even if the lines you see in this video is nothing compared to what they ski in the freeride world tour. You gotta start somewhere right? :P

Key lessons learned from competing:
- Easy to be cocky when scouting from the bottom. Expect shit to get rather scary standing ontop of your line.
- Drops are bigger than you think and the landings might be flatter than it looks from the bottom.
- Scout drops from as many angles as you can. Bottom, side, top. 
- Ski within your limits and build your confidence slowly and ski harder at your 2nd and 3rd comp with more confidence. 
- 30% of the competitors crashed 1 of their 2 runs = overestimated there skills. So if you stand your 2 runs you can easily beat the bottom 30%

58QWRqlZLso,How to Flatspin and Rodeo on Skis,Freestyle,Tutorial,Inversions,Advanced,2020-02-12T12:00:00Z,"In this ski tutorial, we are going to learn how to flatspin on skis and how to rodeo on skis. To learn the trick we off course have a look at what’s the difference is between the two and how the tricks are done on trampoline. Some of you are going to think they should be named the inverse but here’s my thinking. The more forwards set is possible to make much less inverted than the trick with the backward set. Thus the real flatspin should be set a wee bit forwards. I too call the crooked backflip a flat 3 every now and then to keep it simple even if I believe the correct name should be rodeo 3. The aviation industry has an explanation for what it is.

I have done my homework and I hope this video may clarify the two tricks and does not add to the confusion.

FIS categories the two tricks into off axis group B plus don’t offer any explaination https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/freestyle-freeski/freeski/trick-list.html
Inline skating flatspin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYWJIJydmoY
https://youtu.be/_r-1TY2D6xM?t=279
Henrik Harlauts Orbital maybe the most flat flatspin but with a switch take of making it some sort of rad bio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KORiXf-u21Y

From wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeskiing#Terminology
Wiki= Rodeo = An off-axis flip thrown backwards with a spin (most commonly 540 - 'Rodeo 5')
Wiki= Flat Spin = An off-axis flip that is thrown over the shoulder. It is in-between a backflip and a lincoln loop. 
On wikipedia they describe the flatspin and rodeo both as tricks that are set backwards. This does not make any sense to me.

4VVlm6sM0qk,Line Blade Review | Testing the Craziest Ski Ever?,All skiing,Review,Gear,NA,2020-03-01T08:35:51Z,"If the ski seems right for you find it here http://bit.ly/lineblade and you´ll support the channel at no extra cost on your side. We recently got to test a crazy new ski from Line skis called Blade. In this video, we run it through a few ski tests to see how it performs, test out the new design and consider whether it lives up to the marketing hype that has surrounded it since its announcement. An all-mountain ski with an emphasis on carving, this crazy ski is a hybrid between a playful freeride ski and an aggressive slalom ski. We were pretty surprised by its performance, what do you think?

4eBvQyIxKdY,How to Ski in One Day | Beginner Learns Parallel Turns,Ski Tech,Tutorial,Turning,Beginner,2019-12-29T08:24:17Z,"In this how-to ski tutorial, we continue teaching Osman how to ski. At the start of the video, the beginner had just learned plough turns and to be able to do parallel turns we teach him step by step. We start teaching him how to traverse on skis, side slip, then we start skiing faster on steeper slopes, then we gradually make him match the skis higher and higher up in his snowplough turns. By the end of our 2h session, he was skiing parallel but on and off back-seated depending on how fast he was going. If you catch yourself skiing back-seated stop skiing jump a few times to find that good skiing posture then continue skiing a bit slower than before if fear is what is making you skiing leaning back.

00:55 Step 1: Traversing
01:57 Step 2: Side slipping
02:47 Step 3: Explore new terrain
03:34 Step 4: Matching the skis in traverse 
04:15 Step 5: Matching skis at the end of the turn
